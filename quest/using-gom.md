# Using Gods of Modding
### Last updated: 5/25/2023

## Note
This guide will follow the steps for using Gods of Modding on Windows 10 or 11. If you are not running Windows 10 or 11, you will not be able to follow this guide.

## Getting Started: Step 1
To get started, grab the latest release of the utility from [GitHub](https://github.com/Masked8bit/Gods-of-Modding/releases/latest) or [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/gods-of-gravity/m/gods-of-modding), and extract it. Don't run it yet, as we still have some setup to do.

## Installing ADB: Step 2
Go [here]() to get the platform-tools you'll need. Once the file finishes downloading, extract it and navigate to the platform-tools folder inside of it. In there, copy the "adb.exe", "AdbWinApi.dll", and "AbdWinUsbApi.dll". Paste these into the Gods of Modding folder alongside "main.exe", "LICENSE", and "icon.ico".

## Running the utility: Step 3
Now, plug your headset into your computer, and run "main.exe". The app should guide you from there. Please note that the program may freeze during installation, however this is normal.
